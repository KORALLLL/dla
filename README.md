# Deep Learning for Audio (DLA)

- Lecture and seminar materials for each week are in `./week*` folders, see `README.md` for materials and instructions
- Any technical issues, ideas, bugs in course materials, contribution ideas - add an issue
- The current version of the course is conducted in **autumn 2024** at the [CS Faculty](https://cs.hse.ru/en/) of [HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/).

For previous years versions, see [Past Versions](#past-versions) section.
